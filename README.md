Work in pairs. 
One student creates a repo and invites the other as a collaborator. 
Discuss the design together and create a wireframe using pencil and paper. 
Create some subtasks (e.g product card, shopping cart).
Create your own branch and start working autonomously on the agreed task.
Add some transition effects.
Once done create a pull request and merge everything into main (solve conflicts together if any).
Send me a screenshot of final result# DessertProject
